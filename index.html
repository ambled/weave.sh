        <h2>What is Weave.</h2>

<p>Weave is a distributed compute and storage spot market to help:</p>

<ul>
<li>users that dislike banner ads to provide revenue to favorite sites </li>
<li>websites that do not want ad networks directing traffic away an alternative revenue source</li>
<li>underutilized servers that cannot be powered down a way to recapture revenue</li>
</ul><p>by solving backlogged requests from public and private compute networks.</p>

<h3>Here to get started right away?</h3>

<p>Head over to our <a href="http://github.com/ambled/weave.sh/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> wiki page on <a href="http://github.com/ambled/weave.sh/wiki">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>The world of waste</h3>

<p>As you are reading this page right now, you are most likely NOT using all of your devices resources to their best advantage. How many cores are driving this display?  1? 2? 4? more?  Is there a multicore GPU powered up but not doing any work?  How many more internet connected devices do you own that are powered on right now?</p>

<p>Much like research grade telescopes of today, in the early days of computers, process time was scheduled in advance to maximize the usage. This was not only due to the demand outpacing supply, computers were expensive to operate due to high energy requirements.</p>

<p>Over time, demand continues to grow to match maturing computers which grew in capacity while shrinking in energy requirements and size.  However, as personal computers began to hit businesses and homes, our individual compute capacity grew to match as much of our peak requirements as we could afford.  The opposite side of this coin is that a significant portion of these overpowered machines are wasted waiting for user input.</p>

<h3>
<em>SOMETHING</em><a href="https://github.com/HoMe" class="user-mention">@HoMe</a>
</h3>

<p>In the late 1990's, distributed.net and SETI@Home became popular volunteer compute grids, where individuals, groups and businesses could donate their excess compute resources to research.  Over the last two decades, many advances have been made in grid computing and many problems have been solved or worked on by millions of idle computers.</p>

<h3>Who can participate</h3>

<p>Right now the grid is being tested, however two types of users can already get started.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users who have computers that are running Java of at least version 1.6</li>
<li>Website/Blog publishers that have returning traffic</li>
</ul><h3>How real is this</h3>

<p>The market currently supports revenue at $.01(USD) per 1000 completed compute units.  Initial tests on a single standard core take about 18 seconds per compute unit. Participating alpha testers will be able to profile their systems by registering, this information will be used to provide better information shortly.
For a single user user with a single core, this works out to around 5 hours per $.01.  For a website optimized for compute, this works out to around $.01 per thousand 30 second page views, more if the user spends longer on the site.  See the [wiki:revenue](<a href="http://github.com/ambled/weave.sh/wiki">http://github.com/ambled/weave.sh/wiki</a></p>

<h3>User transparency</h3>

<p>One of the most important aspects of the weave grid is transparency of the cloud.  To earn credit for contributed computing resources, users will need to register for a unique Id that shows they agree to using their bandwidth and computer cycles.  Revenue generated from compute without a valid user Id will be split between the weave.sh network for operations support (50%) and approved non-profit organizations (50%). The totals of unregistered work units will be published at least weekly.</p>
